# A-cross-domain-recommender-system-using-deep-coupled-autoencoders
Cross-domain recommendation tackles data sparsity and cold-start by leveraging knowledge across domains. This repo introduces two coupled autoencoder-based deep learning methods that jointly learn representations and mappings for users/items, achieving superior performance in extreme cold-start scenarios.
